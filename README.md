## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### Continued development

I want to continue focusing on front end development, but specifically, for this challenge, I saw that the box-shadow was a bit tricky to do and I still have not fully recreated the design because of that nasty box-shadow. So one area to focus on is the box shadow :).
